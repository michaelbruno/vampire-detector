In the midway of this our mortal life
I found me in a gloomy wood astray
Gone from the path direct and even to tell
It were no easy task how savage wild
That forest how robust and rough its growth
Which to remember only my dismay
Renews in bitterness not far from death
Yet to discourse of what there good befell
All else will I relate discovered there
How first I entered it I scarce can say
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weighed
My senses down when the true path I left
But when a mountain's foot I reached, where closed
The valley, that had pierced my heart with dread
I looked aloft and saw his shoulders broad
Already vested with that planets beam
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way

Then was a little respite to the fear
That in my hearts recesses deep had lain
All of that night so pitifully passed
And as a man with difficult short breath
Forespent with toiling escaped from sea to shore
Turns to the perilous wide waste and stands
At gaze even so my spirit that yet failed
Struggling with terror turned to view the straits
That none hath passed and lived.
